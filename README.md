The dice panel generates and renders 3d die, applies physics, waits for the die/dice to settle before returning the result determined by calculating the most upwards facing and highest face on each die and the number value associated with said face.
Smooth and reliable rendering and calculations, though styling could be better and canvas textures on complex shapes needs adjustment.
